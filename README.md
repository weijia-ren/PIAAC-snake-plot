## Introduction 

This project is a showcase of a ranking plot which visualizes the U.S. adult literacy competencies, specifically, the average adult literacy scale scores of all the states in the U.S., based on data collected between 2012 and 2017. 

The plot shows the the estimates as well as the corresponding confidence intervals, in descending order. The average literacy scale scores of the whole U.S. is also shown in orange and red box at the top of the plot. Each state, therefore, can be compared to the average U.S. score. The colors were chosen to meet the 508 compliance standard. 

Plot titles and caps were set to left-align. 

The non-overlapping confidence intervals could indicate significant differences between the two observations/cases. 

## Data

The data used for this example is obtained from the PIAAC program, and are publicly available and downloaded from the [PIAAC Skills Map](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/).
